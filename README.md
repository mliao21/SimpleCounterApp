# Simple Counter

In this project, I build a simple Counter application with React.

There are two buttons: Up and Down, which increments and decrements the counter value, respectively.

There is also a text input where you can put a number and assign it to the counter. To assign a new value, you can either press Enter when the input box is focused, or click on the Assign button.
